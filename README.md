## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript DOM manipulation

### What I learned

This was a great excercise to practice what I have been learning. The JavaScript was a little more complex than the previous project as there are more input fields in this one as well as more validation rules.

### Continued development

I feel pretty good about the result but it is possible that the JavaScript could be improved in some way. I would like to see how other developers approach this type of projects and learn from them.

### Useful resources

- [HTML Element Reference - By Category](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/ref_byfunc.asp) - This is a nice resource to remember HTML tags. The tags are ordered by category so it's easy to find what you're looking for.
